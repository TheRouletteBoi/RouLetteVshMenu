      <P>The bcp utility is a tool for extracting subsets of Boost, it's useful for 
         Boost authors who want to distribute their library separately from Boost, and 
         for Boost users who want to distribute a subset of Boost with their 
         application.</P>
      <P>bcp can also report on which parts of Boost your code is dependent on, and what 
         licences are used by those dependencies.</P>
      <H2>Examples:</H2>
      <PRE>bcp scoped_ptr /foo</PRE>
      <P>Copies boost/scoped_ptr.hpp and dependencies to /foo.</P>
      <PRE>bcp boost/regex.hpp /foo</PRE>
      <P>Copies boost/regex.hpp and all dependencies including the regex source code (in 
         libs/regex/src) and build files (in libs/regex/build) to /foo.&nbsp; Does not 
         copy the regex documentation, &nbsp;test, or example code.</P>
      <PRE>bcp regex /foo</PRE>
      <P>Copies the full regex lib (in libs/regex) including dependencies (such as the 
         boost.test source required by the regex test programs) to /foo.</P>
      <PRE>bcp regex config build /foo</PRE>
      <P>Copies the full regex lib (in libs/regex) plus the config lib (libs/config) and 
         the build system (tools/build) to /foo including all the dependencies.</P>
      <PRE>bcp --scan --boost=/boost foo.cpp bar.cpp boost</PRE>
      <P>Scans the [non-boost] files foo.cpp and bar.cpp for boost dependencies and 
         copies those dependencies to the sub-directory boost.</P>
      <PRE>bcp --report regex.hpp boost-regex-report.html</PRE>
      <P>Creates a HTML report called <EM>boost-regex-report.html</EM> for the boost 
         module <EM>regex.hpp</EM>.&nbsp; The report contains license information, 
         author details, and file dependencies.</P>
      <H2>Syntax:</H2>
      <PRE>bcp --list [options] module-list</PRE>
      <P>Outputs a list of all the files in module-list including dependencies.</P>
      <PRE>bcp [options] module-list output-path</PRE>
      <P>Copies all the files found in module-list to output-path</P>
      <PRE>bcp --report [options] module-list html-file</PRE>
      <P>Outputs a html report file containing:</P>
      <UL>
         <LI>
         All the licenses in effect, plus the files using each license, and 
         the&nbsp;copyright holders&nbsp;using each license.
         <LI>
         Any files with no recognizable license (please report these to the boost 
         mailing lists).
         <LI>
         Any files with no recognizable copyright holders (please report these to the 
         boost mailing lists).
         <LI>
         All the copyright holders and the files on which they hold copyright.
         <LI>
            File dependency information - indicates the reason for the inclusion of any 
            particular file in the dependencies found.</LI></UL>
      <H3>Options:</H3>
      <PRE>--boost=path</PRE>
      <P>Sets the location of the boost tree to <EM>path.&nbsp;</EM> If this option is 
         not provided then the current path is assumed to be the root directory of the 
         Boost tree.</P>
      <PRE>--scan</PRE>
      <P>Treats the module list as a list of (probably non-boost) files to scan for 
         boost dependencies, the files listed in the module list are not copied (or 
         listed), only the boost files upon which they depend.</P>
      <PRE>--svn</PRE>
      <P>Only copy files under svn version control.</P>
      <PRE>--unix-lines</PRE>
      <P>Make sure that all copied files use Unix style line endings.</P>
      <H4>module-list:&nbsp;</H4>
      <P>When the --scan option is not used then&nbsp;a list of boost files or library 
         names to copy, this can be:</P>
      <OL>
         <LI>
         The name of a tool: for example "build" will find "tools/build".
         <LI>
         The name of a library: for example "regex".
         <LI>
         The title of a header: for example "scoped_ptr" will find 
         "boost/scoped_ptr.hpp".
         <LI>
         The name of a header: for example "scoped_ptr.hpp" will find 
         "boost/scoped_ptr.hpp".
         <LI>
            The name of a file: for example "boost/regex.hpp".</LI></OL>
      <P>When the --scan option is used, then a list of (probably non-boost) files to 
         scan for boost dependencies, the files in the module list are not therefore 
         copied/listed.</P>
      <H4>output-path:
      </H4>
      <P>The path to which files will be copied (this path must exist).</P>
      <H2>Dependencies</H2>
      <P>File dependencies are found as follows:</P>
      <UL>
         <LI>
            C++ source files are scanned for #includes, all #includes present in the boost 
            source tree will then be scanned for their dependencies and so on.</LI>
         <LI>
            C++ source files are associated with the name of a library, if that library has 
            source code (and possibly build data), then include that source in the 
            dependencies.</LI>
         <LI>
            C++ source files are checked for dependencies on Boost.test (for example to see 
            if they use cpp_main as an entry point).</LI>
         <LI>
            HTML files are scanned for immediate dependencies (images and style sheets, but 
            not links).</LI></UL>
      <P>It should be noted that in practice bcp can produce a rather "fat" list of 
         dependencies, reasons for this include:</P>
      <UL>
         <LI>
            It searches for library names first, so using "regex" as a name will give you 
            everything in the libs/regex directory and everything that depends on.&nbsp; 
            This can be a long list as all the regex test and example programs will get 
            scanned for their dependencies.&nbsp; If you want a more minimal list, then try 
            using the names of the headers you are actually including, or use the --scan 
            option to scan your source code.</LI>
         <LI>
            If you include the header of a library with separate source, then you get that 
            libraries source and all it's dependencies.&nbsp; This is deliberate and in 
            general those extra dependencies are needed.</LI>
         <LI>
            When you include a header, bcp doesn't know what compiler you're using, so it 
            follows all possible preprocessor paths. If you're distributing a subset of 
            Boost with you're application then that is what you want to have happen in 
            general.</LI></UL>
      <P>The last point above can result in a substantial increase in the number of 
         headers found compared to most peoples expectations.&nbsp; For example bcp 
         finds 274 header dependencies for boost/shared_ptr.hpp: by running bcp in 
         report mode we can see why all these headers have been found as dependencies:</P>
      <UL>
         <LI>
            All of the Config&nbsp;library headers get included&nbsp;(52 headers, would be 
            about 6 for one compiler only).</LI>
         <LI>
            A lot of MPL and type traits code that includes workarounds for broken 
            compilers that you may or may not need.&nbsp; Tracing back through the code 
            shows that most of these aren't needed unless the user has 
            defined&nbsp;BOOST_SP_USE_QUICK_ALLOCATOR, however bcp isn't aware of whether 
            that preprocessor path will be taken or not, so the headers get included just 
            in case.&nbsp; This adds about 48 headers (type traits), plus another 49 from 
            MPL.</LI>
         <LI>
            The Preprocessor library gets used heavily by MPL: this adds another 96 
            headers.</LI>
         <LI>
            The Shared Pointer library contains a lot of platform specific code, split up 
            into around 22 headers: normally your compiler would need only a couple of 
            these files.</LI></UL>
      <P>As you can see the number of dependencies found are much larger than those used 
         by any single compiler, however if you want to distribute a subset of Boost 
         that's usable in any configuration, by any compiler, on any platform then 
         that's exactly what you need.&nbsp; If you want to figure out which Boost 
         headers are being used by your <EM>specific </EM>compiler then the best way to 
         find out is to prepocess the code and scan the output for boost header 
         includes.&nbsp; You should be aware that the result will be very platform and 
         compiler specific, and may not contain all the headers needed if you so much as 
         change a compiler switch (for example turn on threading support).</P>

      This version of Spirit is a complete rewrite of the <span class="emphasis"><em>classic</em></span>
      Spirit many people have been contributing to (see below). But there are a couple
      of people who already managed to help significantly during this rewrite. We
      would like to express our special acknowledgement to:
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Eric Niebler</b></span> for writing Boost.Proto, without
      which this rewrite wouldn't have been possible, and helping with examples,
      advices, and suggestions on how to use Boost.Proto in the best possible way.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Ben Hanson</b></span> for providing us with an early
      version of his Lexertl library, which is proposed to be included into Boost
      (as Boost.Lexer), but at the time of this writing the Boost review for this
      library is still pending.
    </p>

      from the Spirit V1 <span class="emphasis"><em>classic</em></span> Documentation</a>
    </h3>
<p>
      Special thanks for working on Spirit <span class="emphasis"><em>classic</em></span> to:
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Dan Nuffer</b></span> for his work on lexers, parse trees,
      ASTs, XML parsers, the multi-pass iterator as well as administering Spirit's
      site, editing, maintaining the CVS and doing the releases plus a zillion of
      other chores that were almost taken for granted.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Hartmut Kaiser</b></span> for his work on the C parser,
      the work on the C/C++ preprocessor, utility parsers, the original port to Intel
      5.0, various work on Phoenix, porting to v1.5, the meta-parsers, the grouping-parsers,
      extensive testing and painstaking attention to details.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Martin Wille</b></span> who improved grammar multi thread
      safety, contributed the eol_p parser, the dynamic parsers, documentation and
      for taking an active role in almost every aspect from brainstorming and design
      to coding. And, as always, helps keep the regression tests for g++ on Linux
      as green as ever :-).
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Martijn W. Van Der Lee</b></span> our Web site administrator
      and for contributing the RFC821 parser.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Giovanni Bajo</b></span> for last minute tweaks of Spirit
      1.8.0 for CodeWarrior 8.3. Actually, I'm ashamed Giovanni was not in this list
      already. He's done a lot since Spirit 1.5, the first Boost.Spirit release.
      He's instrumental in the porting of the Spirit iterators stuff to the new Boost
      Iterators Library (version 2). He also did various bug fixes and wrote some
      tests here and there.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Juan Carlos Arevalo-Baeza (JCAB)*</b></span> for his
      work on the C++ parser, the position iterator, ports to v1.5 and keeping the
      mailing list discussions alive and kicking.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Vaclav Vesely</b></span>, lots of stuff, the no_actions
      directive, various patches fixes, the distinct parsers, the lazy parser, some
      phoenix tweaks and add-ons (e.g. new_). Also, *Stefan Slapeta] and wife for
      editing Vaclav's distinct parser doc.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Raghavendra Satish</b></span> for doing the original
      v1.3 port to VC++ and his work on Phoenix.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Noah Stein</b></span> for following up and helping Ragav
      on the VC++ ports.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Hakki Dogusan</b></span>, for his original v1.0 Pascal
      parser.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>John (EBo) David</b></span> for his work on the VM and
      watching over my shoulder as I code giving the impression of distance eXtreme
      programming.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Chris Uzdavinis</b></span> for feeding in comments and
      valuable suggestions as well as editing the documentation.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Carsten Stoll</b></span>, for his work on dynamic parsers.
    </p>

      <span class="bold"><b>Andy Elvey</b></span> and his conifer parser.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Bruce Florman</b></span>, who did the original v1.0 port
      to VC++.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Jeff Westfahl</b></span> for porting the loop parsers
      to v1.5 and contributing the file iterator.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Peter Simons</b></span> for the RFC date parser example
      and tutorial plus helping out with some nitty gritty details.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Markus Schöpflin</b></span> for suggesting the end_p parser
      and lots of other nifty things and his active presence in the mailing list.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Doug Gregor</b></span> for mentoring and his ability
      to see things that others don't.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>David Abrahams</b></span> for giving Joel a job that
      allows him to still work on Spirit, plus countless advice and help on C++ and
      specifically template metaprogramming.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Aleksey Gurtovoy</b></span> for his MPL library from
      which we stole many metaprogramming tricks especially for less conforming compilers
      such as Borland and VC6/7.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Gustavo Guerra</b></span> for his last minute review
      of Spirit and constant feedback, plus patches here and there (e.g. proposing

    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><b>Joao Abecasis</b></span> for his active presence in the
      Spirit mailing list, providing user support, participating in the discussions
      and so on.

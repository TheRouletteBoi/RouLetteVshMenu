[h4 Boost-1.36.0]

* Added Noncentral Chi Squared Distribution.
* Added Noncentral Beta Distribution.
* Added Noncentral F Distribution.
* Added Noncentral T Distribution.
* Added Exponential Integral Functions.
* Added Zeta Function.
* Added Rounding and Truncation functions.
* Added Compile time powers of runtime bases.
* Added SSE2 optimizations for Lanczos evaluation.

[h4 Boost-1.35.0: Post Review First Official Release]

* Added Policy based framework that allows fine grained control
over function behaviour.
* [*Breaking change:] Changed default behaviour for domain, pole and overflow errors
to throw an exception (based on review feedback), this
behaviour can be customised using __Policy's.
* [*Breaking change:] Changed exception thrown when an internal evaluation error
occurs to boost::math::evaluation_error.
* [*Breaking change:] Changed discrete quantiles to return an integer result:
this is anything up to 20 times faster than finding the true root, this
behaviour can be customised using __Policy's.
* Polynomial/rational function evaluation is now customisable and hopefully
faster than before.
* Added performance test program.

[h4 Milestone 4: Second Review Candidate (1st March 2007)]

* Moved Xiaogang Zhang's Bessel Functions code into the library,
and brought them into line with the rest of the code.
* Added C# "Distribution Explorer" demo application.

[h4 Milestone 3: First Review Candidate (31st Dec 2006)]

* Implemented the main probability distribution and density functions.
* Implemented digamma.
* Added more factorial functions.
* Implemented the Hermite, Legendre and Laguerre polynomials plus the 
spherical harmonic functions from TR1.
* Moved Xiaogang Zhang's elliptic integral code into the library,
and brought them into line with the rest of the code.
* Moved Hubert Holin's existing Boost.Math special functions
into this library and brought them into line with the rest of the code.

[h4 Milestone 2: Released September 10th 2006]

* Implement preview release of the statistical distributions.
* Added statistical distributions tutorial.
* Implemented root finding algorithms.
* Implemented the inverses of the incomplete gamma and beta functions.
* Rewrite erf/erfc as rational approximations (valid to 128-bit precision).
* Integrated the statistical results generated from
the test data with Boost.Test: uses a database of expected
results, indexed by test, floating point type, platform, and compiler.
* Improved lgamma near 1 and 2 (rational approximations).
* Improved erf/erfc inverses (rational approximations).
* Implemented Rational function generation (the Remez method).

[h4 Milestone 1: Released March 31st 2006]

* Implement gamma/beta/erf functions along with their incomplete counterparts.
* Generate high quality test data, against which future improvements can be judged.
* Provide tools for the evaluation of infinite series, continued fractions, and
rational functions.
* Provide tools for testing against tabulated test data, and collecting statistics
on error rates.
* Provide sufficient docs for people to be able to find their way around the library.

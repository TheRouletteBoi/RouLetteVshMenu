Hubert Holin started the Boost.Math library.  The inverse
hyperbolic functions, and the sinus cardinal functions are his.

John Maddock started this library, the beta, gamma, erf, polynomial,
and factorial functions are his, as is the "Toolkit" section, and many
of the statistical distributions.

Paul A. Bristow threw down the challenge in 
[@http://www2.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2004/n1668.pdf 
A Proposal to add Mathematical Functions for Statistics to the C++ 
Standard Library] to add the key math functions, especially those essential for
statistics. After JM accepted and solved the difficult problems, 
not only numerically, but in full C++ template style, PAB
implemented a few of the statistical distributions. PAB also tirelessly 
proof-read everything that JM threw at him (so that all
remaining editorial mistakes are his fault).

Xiaogang Zhang worked on the Bessel functions and elliptic integrals for his
Google Summer of Code project 2006.

Bruno Lalande submitted the "compile time power of a runtime base" code.

Professor Nico Temme for advice on the inverse incomplete beta function.

[@http://www.shoup.net Victor Shoup for NTL], 
without which it would have much difficult to 
produce high accuracy constants, and especially
the tables of accurate values for testing.

We are grateful to Joel Guzman for helping us stress-test
his 
[@http://www.boost.org/tools/quickbook/index.htm Boost.Quickbook] 
program used to generate the html and pdf versions
of this document, adding several new features en route.

Plots of the functions and distributions were prepared in
[@http://www.w3.org/ W3C] standard
[@http://www.svg.org/ Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG)] format
using a program created by Jacob Voytko during a
[@http://code.google.com/soc/2007/ Google Summer of Code (2007)].
Since browser support for rendering SVG is still not universal
(Microsoft Internet Explorer, even IE 8 beta, still lacks native SVG support
but can be made to work with
[@http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/ Adobe's free SVG viewer] plugin),
so the SVG files were batch converted to JPEG using
[@http://www.inkscape.org/ Inkscape]. 

We are also indebted to Matthias Schabel for managing the formal Boost-review
of this library, and to all the reviewers - including Guillaume Melquiond,
Arnaldur Gylfason, John Phillips, Stephan Tolksdorf and Jeff Garland 
- for their many helpful comments.

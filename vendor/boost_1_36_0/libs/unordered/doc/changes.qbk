[h2 Review Version]

Initial review version, for the review conducted from 7th December 2007 to
16th December 2007.

[h2 1.35.0 Add-on - 31st March 2008]

Unofficial release uploaded to vault, to be used with Boost 1.35.0. Incorporated
many of the suggestions from the review.

* Improved portability thanks to Boost regression testing.
* Fix lots of typos, and clearer text in the documentation.
* Fix floating point to `std::size_t` conversion when calculating sizes from
  the max load factor, and use `double` in the calculation for greater accuracy.
* Fix some errors in the examples.

[h2 Boost 1.36.0]

First official release.

* Rearrange the internals.
* Move semantics - full support when rvalue references are available, emulated
  using a cut down version of the Adobe move library when they are not.
* Emplace support when rvalue references and variadic template are available.
* More efficient node allocation when rvalue references and variadic template
  are available.
* Added equality operators.

<h2><a name="serialization"></a>The term "serialization" is preferred to "persistence"</h2>
<p>
I found that persistence is often used to refer
to something quite different. Examples are storage of class
instances (objects) in database schema <a href="bibliography.html#4">[4]</a>
This library will be useful in other contexts besides implementing persistence. The
most obvious case is that of marshalling data for transmission to another system.
<h2><a name="archives"></a>Archives are not streams</h2>
<p>
Archive classes are <strong>NOT</strong> derived from
streams even though they have similar syntax rules.
<ul>
    <li>Archive classes are not kinds of streams though they
    are implemented in terms of streams. This
    distinction is addressed in <a href="bibliography.html#5">[5]</a> item number item 41 .
    <li>We don't want users to insert/extract&nbsp;data
    directly into/from &nbsp;the stream .&nbsp; This could
    create a corrupted archive. Were archives
    derived from streams, it would possible to
    accidentally do this. So archive classes
    only define operations which are safe and necessary.
    <li>The usage of streams to implement the archive classes that
    are included in the library is merely convenient - not necessary.
    Library users may well want to define their own archive format
    which doesn't use streams at all.
</ul>
<h2><a name="primitives"></a>Archive Members are Templates 
Rather than Virtual Functions</h2>
The previous version of this library defined virtual functions for all
primitive types.  These were overridden by each archive class.  There were
two issues related to this:
</ul>
    <li>Some disliked virtual functions because of the added execution time
    overhead.
    <li>This caused implementation difficulties since the set of primitive
    data types varies between platforms.  Attempting to define the correct
    set of virtual functions, (think <code style="white-space: normal">long long</code>, 
    <code style="white-space: normal">__int64</code>, 
    etc.) resulted in messy and fragile code.  Replacing this with templates
    and letting the compiler generate the code for the primitive types actually
    used, resolved this problem.  Of course, the ripple effects of this design
    change were significant, but in the end led to smaller, faster, more
    maintainable code.
</ul>
<h2><a name="strings"></a><code style="white-space: normal">std::strings</code> are treated specially in text files</h2>
<p>
Treating strings as STL vectors would result in minimal code size. This was
not done because:
<ul>
     <li>In text archives it is convenient to be able to view strings.  Our text
     implementation stores single characters as integers.  Storing strings
     as a vector of characters would waste space and render the archives
     inconvenient for debugging.
     <li>Stream implementations have special functions for <code style="white-space: normal">std::string</code>
     and <code style="white-space: normal">std::wstring</code>.
     Presumably they optimize appropriately.
     <li>Other specializations of <code style="white-space: normal">std::basic_string</code> are in fact handled
     as vectors of the element type.
</ul>
</p>
<h2><a name="typeid"></a><code style="white-space: normal">typeid</code> information is not included in archives</h2>
<p>
I originally thought that I had to save the name of the class specified by <code style="white-space: normal">std::type_of::name()</code>
in the archive. This created difficulties as <code style="white-space: normal">std::type_of::name()</code> is not portable and
not guaranteed to return the class name. This makes it almost useless for implementing
archive portability.  This topic is explained in much more detail in
<a href="bibliography.html#6">[7] page 206</a>. It turned out that it was not necessary.
As long as objects are loaded in the exact sequence as they were saved, the type
is available when loading.  The only exception to this is the case of polymorphic
pointers never before loaded/saved.  This is addressed with the <code style="white-space: normal">register_type()</code>
and/or <code style="white-space: normal">export</code> facilities described in the reference.  
In effect, <code style="white-space: normal">export</code> generates a portable equivalent to
<code style="white-space: normal">typeid</code> information.

<h2><a name="trap"></a>Compile time trap when saving a non-const value</h2>
</p>
The following code will fail to compile.  The failure will occur on a line with a
<code style="white-space: normal">BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT</code>.  
Here, we refer to this as a compile time trap.
<code style="white-space: normal"><pre>
T t;
ar &lt;&lt; t;
</pre></code>

unless the tracking_level serialization trait is set to "track_never". The following
will compile without problem:

<code style="white-space: normal"><pre>
const T t
ar &lt;&lt; t;
</pre></code>

Likewise, the following code will trap at compile time:

<code style="white-space: normal"><pre>
T * t;
ar >> t;
</pre></code>

if the tracking_level serialization trait is set to "track_never".
<p>

This behavior has been contraversial and may be revised in the future. The criticism 
is that it will flag code that is in fact correct and force users to insert
<code style="white-space: normal">const_cast</code>. My view is that:
<ul>
  <li>The trap is useful in detecting a certain class of programming errors.
  <li>Such errors would otherwise be difficult to detect.
  <li>The incovenience caused by including this trap is very small in relation
  to its benefits.
</ul>

The following case illustrates my position.  It was originally used as an example in the
mailing list by Peter Dimov.

<code style="white-space: normal"><pre>
class construct_from 
{ 
    ... 
}; 

void main(){ 
    ... 
    Y y; 
    construct_from x(y); 
    ar &lt;&lt; x; 
} 
</pre></code>

Suppose that there is no trap as described above.
<ol>
  <li>this example compiles and executes fine. No tracking is done because 
  construct_from has never been serialized through a pointer. Now some time 
  later, the next programmer(2) comes along and makes an enhancement. He 
  wants the archive to be sort of a log. 

<code style="white-space: normal"><pre>
void main(){ 
    ... 
    Y y; 
    construct_from x(y); 
    ar &lt;&lt; x; 
    ... 
    x.f(); // change x in some way 
   ... 
    ar &lt;&lt; x 
} 
</pre></code>
  <p>
  Again no problem. He gets two different of copies in the archive, each one is different. 
  That is he gets exactly what he expects and is naturally delighted. 
  <p>
  <li>Now sometime later, a third programmer(3) sees construct_from and says - 
  oh cool, just what I need. He writes a function in a totally disjoint 
  module. (The project is so big, he doesn't even realize the existence of 
  the original usage) and writes something like: 

<code style="white-space: normal"><pre>
class K { 
    shared_ptr &lt;construct_from&gt; z; 
    template &lt;class Archive&gt; 
    void serialize(Archive & ar, const unsigned version){ 
        ar &lt;&lt; z; 
    } 
}; 
</pre></code>

  <p>
  He builds and runs the program and tests his new functionality. It works 
  great and he's delighted. 
  <p>
  <li>Things continue smoothly as before.  A month goes by and it's 
  discovered that when loading the archives made in the last month (reading the 
  log). Things don't work. The second log entry is always the same as the 
  first. After a series of very long and increasingly acrimonius email exchanges, 
its discovered 
  that programmer (3) accidently broke programmer(2)'s code .This is because by 
  serializing via a pointer, the "log" object now being tracked.  This is because
  the default tracking behavior is "track_selectively".  This means that class
  instances are tracked only if they are serialized through pointers anywhere in
  the program. Now multiple saves from the same address result in only the first one 
  being written to the archive. Subsequent saves only add the address - even though the 
  data might have been changed.  When it comes time to load the data, all instances of the log record show the same data.
  In this way, the behavior of a functioning piece of code is changed due the side
  effect of a change in an otherwise disjoint module.
  Worse yet, the data has been lost and cannot not be now recovered from the archives.
  People are really upset and disappointed with boost (at least the serialization system).
  <p>
  <li>
  After a lot of investigation, it's discovered what the source of the problem
  and class construct_from is marked "track_never" by including:
<code style="white-space: normal"><pre>
BOOST_CLASS_TRACKING(construct_from, track_never) 
</pre></code>
  <li>Now everything works again. Or - so it seems.
  <p>
  <li><code style="white-space: normal">shared_ptr&lt;construct_from&gt;</code>
is not going to have a single raw pointer shared amongst the instances. Each loaded 
<code style="white-space: normal">shared_ptr&lt;construct_from&gt;</code> is going to 
have its own distinct raw pointer. This will break 
<code style="white-space: normal">shared_ptr</code> and cause a memory leak.  Again,
The cause of this problem is very far removed from the point of discovery.  It could 
well be that the problem is not even discovered until after the archives are loaded.
Now we not only have difficult to find and fix program bug, but we have a bunch of
invalid archives and lost data.
</ol>

Now consider what happens when the trap is enabled:. 

<ol>
  <p>
  <li>Right away, the program traps at 
<code style="white-space: normal"><pre>
ar &lt;&lt; x; 
</pre></code>
  <p>
  <li>The programmer curses (another %^&*&* hoop to jump through). If he's in a 
  hurry (and who isn't) and would prefer not to <code style="white-space: normal">const_cast</code>
  - because it looks bad.  So he'll just make the following change an move on. 
<code style="white-space: normal"><pre>
Y y; 
const construct_from x(y); 
ar &lt;&lt; x; 
</pre></code>
  <p>
  Things work fine and he moves on. 
  <p>
  <li>Now programer (2) wants to make his change - and again another 
  annoying const issue; 
<code style="white-space: normal"><pre>
Y y; 
const construct_from x(y); 
... 
x.f(); // change x in some way ; compile error f() is not const 
... 
ar &lt;&lt; x 
</pre></code>
  <p>
  He's mildly annoyed now he tries the following: 
  <ul>
    <li>He considers making f() a const - but presumable that shifts the const 
    error to somewhere else. And his doesn't want to fiddle with "his" code to 
    work around a quirk in the serializaition system 
    <p>
    <li>He removes the <code style="white-space: normal">const</code>
    from <code style="white-space: normal">const construct_from</code> above - damn now he 
    gets the trap. If he looks at the comment code where the 
    <code style="white-space: normal">BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT</code>
    occurs, he'll do one of two things 
    <ol>
      <p>
      <li>This is just crazy. Its making my life needlessly difficult and flagging 
      code that is just fine. So I'll fix this with a <code style="white-space: normal">const_cast</code>
      and fire off a complaint to the list and mabe they will fix it. 
      In this case, the story branches off to the previous scenario.
      <p>
      <li>Oh, this trap is suggesting that the default serialization isn't really 
      what I want. Of course in this particular program it doesn't matter. But 
      then the code in the trap can't really evaluate code in other modules (which 
      might not even be written yet). OK, I'll add the following to my 
      construct_from.hpp to solve the problem. 
<code style="white-space: normal"><pre>
BOOST_CLASS_TRACKING(construct_from, track_never) 
</pre></code>
    </ol>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <li>Now programmer (3) comes along and make his change. The behavior of the 
  original (and distant module) remains unchanged because the 
  <code style="white-space: normal">construct_from</code> trait has been set to 
  "track_never" so he should always get copies and the log should be what we expect.
  <p>
  <li>But now he gets another trap - trying to save an object of a 
  class marked "track_never" through a pointer. So he goes back to 
  construct_from.hpp and comments out the 
  <code style="white-space: normal">BOOST_CLASS_TRACKING</code> that 
  was inserted. Now the second trap is avoided, But damn - the first trap is 
  popping up again. Eventually, after some code restructuring, the differing
  requirements of serializating <code style="white-space: normal">construct_from</code>
  are reconciled.
</ol>
Note that in this second scenario
<ul>
  <li>all errors are trapped at compile time.
  <li>no invalid archives are created.
  <li>no data is lost.
  <li>no runtime errors occur.
</ul>

It's true that these traps may sometimes flag code that is currently correct and
that this may be annoying to some programmers.  However, this example illustrates
my view that these traps are useful and that any such annoyance is small price to
pay to avoid particularly vexing programming errors.

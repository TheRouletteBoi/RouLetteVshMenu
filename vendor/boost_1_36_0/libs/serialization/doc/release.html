As of this is written, there are no known bugs. However, due to compiler/library quirks and or 
bugs, some tests fail with some combinations of compilers and libraries.
<h2><a name="requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>
This library has been tested on Boost version 1.34 and 1.35.

<!--
<p>
The serialization library uses the boost spirit package to load XML archives.
We have found that all tests pass using spirit 1.6x. Spirit 1.8 and higher does not work with
older compilers - specifically MSVC 6, Borland and GCC < 3.0.
If you are using one of these compilers, you may download a version
of spirit 1.6 <a href="http://spirit.sourceforge.net/index.php?doc=download/index.html">here</a>.
To use this downloaded version rather than the one included with boost,
set an environmental variable SPIRIT_ROOT to be equal to the root 
directory where the downloaded copy of spirit has been placed. E. G.
<pre><code>
set SPIRIT_ROOT=c:/spirit16
</code></pre>
If you're not using bjam and the Jamfile to build the library, be sure that
the directory which contains the version of spirit you plan to use is placed
at the front of the list of include paths.

<h2><a name="differences_1_35"></a>Differences from Boost 1.35</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The library is now thread safe.  That is, multiple archives can be open
    in different threads.  This has been implmented with a lock-free algorithm
    to avoid any performance bottlenecks.
    <li>Serialization of types defined in shared libraries is now supported.
    shared libraries (DLLS) can be loaded/unloaded dynamically at runtime.
    This includes the serialization of instances of abstract base classes so that
    a program can be written so as to be compatible with as yet undefined
    and un-implemented code.
    <li>The extended type info system has been enhanced to in order to implement
    the above.  It is now a general purpose system for creating and casting of
    types about which is only known a string ID and an abstract base class.
    <li>All bug reports filed as TRAK tickets have been addressed.
    <li>As of this writing, the library will fail build on older compilers such
    as MSVC before version 7.1 and older versions of Borland compilers.  This
    might or might not change in the future.
</ul>

<h2><a name="differences_1_34"></a>Differences from Boost 1.34</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enhanced support for fast serialization for native binary archives. By Mattias Troyer.
    <li>Improved implementation of "export" functionality.  Removes header ordering
        requirement and eliminates the maintenance of a pre-determined list of "known archives"
        By David Abrahams.
    <li>Improved support for STLPort.
</ul>

<h2><a name="differences_1_33"></a>Differences from Boost 1.33</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Native Binary archives use the <code style="white-space: normal">std::streambuf</code> interface.
    This should result in noticeably faster execution in many cases.
</ul>

<h2><a name="differences_1_32"></a>Differences from Boost 1.32</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dynamic Linking Library (DLLs and shared libraries) for platforms which support them. See
    <a href="../../../more/getting_started/windows.html#auto-linking">Automatic Linking on Windows</a>.
    <li>Implementation of auto-link for compilers which can support this.
    <li>Better support for <em>Argument Dependent Lookup</em> and two-phase lookup.
    This results in simpler rules regarding the placing of serialization specializations
    namespaces.
    <li>Enhanced documentation to help explain usage of the above.
    <li>Adjustments to improve support for less conformant compilers.
    <li>Improved <code>const</code> correctness for save/load operators.  Note that this may
    produce compile time errors in code which compiled without problem in earlier boost releases.
    In most cases the fix is trivial.  In other cases, code should be scrutinized to be
    sure that it doesn't use the serialization system in a way which may introduce subtle bugs in
    to the program.  A fuller explanation of this issue can be found
    <a target="detail" href="traits.html#tracking">here</a>.
    <li>A new implementation of serialization for <code style="white-space: normal">shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>.  This
    is compatible with public interface of <code style="white-space: normal">shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>
    so it should be more robust and not have to change in the future.  The implementation optionally
    includes code to load <code style="white-space: normal">shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> stored in 
    archives created with boost 1.32.  This code is stored in the header:
    <code style="white-space: normal">boost/serialization/shared_ptr_132.hpp</code>. If your application
    needs to load archives created with boost 1.32 libraries, include the above header
    before each inclusion of <code style="white-space: normal">boost/serialization/shared_ptr.hpp</code>.
    <li>More compilers tested and supported.
    <li>Miscellaneous bug fixes.
</ul>

<h2><a name="todo"></a>Pending issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>currently can't serialize through a pointer an object a of class
    that implements its own <code style="white-space: normal">new/delete</code> operators.
    <li>Its possible that <code style="white-space: normal">std::string</code>
    and <code style="white-space: normal">std::wstring</code> contain characters such as
    '\0' and -1 (EOF) which cannot be rendered in text and XML archives without an escape mechanism.
    Currently there is no such escape mechanism implemented.
    <li>A subtle error in the implementation of serializaton of <code style="white-space: normal">std::map</code>
    is fixed in this version.  Unfortunately, the fix breaks serialization of
    <code style="white-space: normal">std::map</code> for those compilers which do not support
    partial template specialization.
 </ul>
<p>
Aside from the above, there are a number of issues related to specific platforms.  
These are listed in <a href="implementation.html#othercompilerissues">Specific Compiler/Library Issues</a>.

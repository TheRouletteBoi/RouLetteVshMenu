  <blockquote>
    "Dynamic memory allocation has been a fundamental part of most computer
    systems since roughly 1960..."<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Everyone uses dynamic memory allocation. If you have ever called
  <span class="code">malloc</span> or <span class="code">new</span>, then you
  have used dynamic memory allocation. Most programmers have a tendency to
  treat the heap as a "magic bag": we ask it for memory, and it magically
  creates some for us. Sometimes we run into problems because the heap is
  <em>not</em> magic.</p>

  <p>The heap is limited. Even on large systems (i.e., not embedded) with
  huge amounts of virtual memory available, there is a limit. Everyone is
  aware of the physical limit, but there is a more subtle, "virtual" limit,
  that limit at which your program (or the entire system) slows down due to
  the use of virtual memory. This virtual limit is much closer to your
  program than the physical limit, especially if you are running on a
  multitasking system. Therefore, when running on a large system, it is
  considered "nice" to make your program use as few resources as necessary,
  and release them as soon as possible. When using an embedded system,
  programmers usually have no memory to waste.</p>

  <p>The heap is complicated. It has to satisfy any type of memory request,
  for any size, and do it <em>fast</em>. The common approaches to memory
  management have to do with splitting the memory up into portions, and
  keeping them ordered by size in some sort of a tree or list structure. Add
  in other factors, such as locality and estimating lifetime, and heaps
  quickly become very complicated. So complicated, in fact, that there is no
  known "perfect" answer to the problem of how to do dynamic memory
  allocation. The diagrams below illustrate how most common memory managers
  work: for each chunk of memory, it uses part of that memory to maintain its
  internal tree or list structure. Even when a chunk is <span class=
  "code">malloc</span>'ed out to a program, the memory manager must "save"
  some information in it &mdash; usually just its size. Then, when the block
  is <span class="code">free</span>'d, the memory manager can easily tell how
  large it is.</p>

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="background-color: silver; text-align: center;">Memory used
      internally by memory allocator algorithm (usually 4 bytes)</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style=

    <tr>
      <td style="background-color: red; text-align: center;">Memory not
      belonging to process</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Because of the complication of dynamic memory allocation, it is often
  inefficient in terms of time and/or space. Most memory allocation
  algorithms store some form of information with each memory block, either
  the block size or some relational information, such as its position in the
  internal tree or list structure. It is common for such "header fields" to
  take up one machine word in a block that is being used by the program. The
  obvious problem, then, is when small objects are dynamically allocated. For
  example, if <span class="code">int</span>s were dynamically allocated, then
  automatically the algorithm will reserve space for the header fields as
  well, and we end up with a 50% waste of memory. Of course, this is a
  worst-case scenario. However, more modern programs are making use of small
  objects on the heap; and that is making this problem more and more
  apparent. Wilson <em>et. al.</em> state that an average-case memory
  overhead is about ten to twenty percent<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>.
  This memory overhead will grow higher as more programs use more smaller
  objects. It is this memory overhead that brings programs closer to the
  virtual limit.</p>

  <p>In larger systems, the memory overhead is not as big of a problem
  (compared to the amount of time it would take to work around it), and thus
  is often ignored. However, there are situations where many allocations
  and/or deallocations of smaller objects are taking place as part of a
  time-critical algorithm, and in these situations, the system-supplied
  memory allocator is often too slow.</p>

  <p>Simple segregated storage addresses both of these issues. Almost all
  memory overhead is done away with, and all allocations can take place in a
  small amount of (amortized) constant time. However, this is done at the
  loss of generality; simple segregated storage only can allocate memory
  chunks of a single size.</p>

  <h1 align="center">Simple Segregated Storage</h1>

  <p>Simple Segregated Storage is the basic idea behind the Boost Pool
  library. Simple Segregated Storage is the simplest, and probably the
  fastest, memory allocation/deallocation algorithm. It begins by
  <em>partitioning</em> a memory <em>block</em> into fixed-size
  <em>chunks</em>. Where the block comes from is not important until
  implementation time. A <em>Pool</em> is some object that uses Simple
  Segregated Storage in this fashion. To illustrate:</p>

  <table cellspacing="0" border="3" rules="none" align="center" style=
  "clear: both;" summary="">
    <caption>
      <em>Memory block, split into chunks</em>
    </caption>

    <tr>
      <td style="background-color: red; text-align: center;">Memory not
      belonging to process</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style=
      "padding: 1em 0em; background-color: gray; text-align: center;">Chunk
      0</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style=
      "padding: 1em 0em; background-color: gray; text-align: center;">Chunk
      1</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style=
      "padding: 1em 0em; background-color: gray; text-align: center;">Chunk
      2</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style=
      "padding: 1em 0em; background-color: gray; text-align: center;">Chunk
      3</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="background-color: red; text-align: center;">Memory not
      belonging to process</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Each of the chunks in any given block are <strong>always</strong> the
  same size. This is the fundamental restriction of Simple Segregated
  Storage: you cannot ask for chunks of different sizes. For example, you
  cannot ask a Pool of integers for a character, or a Pool of characters for
  an integer (assuming that characters and integers are different sizes).</p>

  <p>Simple Segregated Storage works by interleaving a <em>free list</em>
  within the unused chunks. For example:</p>

  <table cellspacing="0" border="3" rules="none" style=
  "float: left; clear: both;" summary="">
    <caption>
      <em>Memory block, with no chunks allocated</em>
    </caption>

    <tr>
      <td style="background-color: red; text-align: center;">Memory not
      belonging to process</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style=
      "padding: 1em 0em; background-color: gray; text-align: center;">Chunk
      0; points to Chunk 1</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style=
      "padding: 1em 0em; background-color: gray; text-align: center;">Chunk
      1; points to Chunk 2</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style=
      "padding: 1em 0em; background-color: gray; text-align: center;">Chunk
      2; points to Chunk 3</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style=
      "padding: 1em 0em; background-color: gray; text-align: center;">Chunk
      3; end-of-list</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="background-color: red; text-align: center;">Memory not
      belonging to process</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <table cellspacing="0" border="3" rules="none" style=
  "float: right; clear: both;" summary="">
    <caption>
      <em>Memory block, with two chunks allocated</em>
    </caption>

    <tr>
      <td style="background-color: red; text-align: center;">Memory not
      belonging to process</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style=
      "padding: 1em 0em; background-color: gray; text-align: center;">Chunk
      0; points to Chunk 2</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style=
      "padding: 1em 0em; background-color: silver; text-align: center;">Chunk
      1 (in use by process)</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style=
      "padding: 1em 0em; background-color: gray; text-align: center;">Chunk
      2; end-of-list</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style=
      "padding: 1em 0em; background-color: silver; text-align: center;">Chunk
      3 (in use by process)</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="background-color: red; text-align: center;">Memory not
      belonging to process</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>By interleaving the free list inside the chunks, each Simple Segregated
  Storage only has the overhead of a single pointer (the pointer to the first
  element in the list). It has <em>no</em> memory overhead for chunks that
  are in use by the process.</p>

  <p>Simple Segregated Storage is also extremely fast. In the simplest case,
  memory allocation is merely removing the first chunk from the free list, a
  O(1) operation. In the case where the free list is empty, another block may
  have to be acquired and partitioned, which would result in an amortized
  O(1) time. Memory deallocation may be as simple as adding that chunk to the
  front of the free list, a O(1) operation. However, more complicated uses of
  Simple Segregated Storage may require a sorted free list, which makes
  deallocation O(N).</p>

  <p>Simple Segregated Storage gives faster execution and less memory
  overhead than a system-supplied allocator, but at the loss of generality. A
  good place to use a Pool is in situations where many (noncontiguous) small
  objects may be allocated on the heap, or if allocation and deallocation of
  the same-sized objects happens repeatedly.<br clear="all"></p>

  <h2>Other Implementations</h2>

  <p>Pool allocators are found in many programming languages, and in many
  variations. The beginnings of many implementations may be found in common
  programming literature; some of these are given below. Note that none of
  these are complete implementations of a Pool; most of these leave some
  aspects of a Pool as a user exercise. However, in each case, even though
  some aspects are missing, these examples use the same underlying concept of
  a Simple Segregated Storage described in this document.</p>

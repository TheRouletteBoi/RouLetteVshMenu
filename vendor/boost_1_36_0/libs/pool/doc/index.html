  <h1 align="center">Boost Pool Library</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <h3>What is Pool?</h3>

  <p>Pool allocation is a memory allocation scheme that is very fast, but 
  limited in its usage. For more information on pool allocation (also called 
  &quot;simple segregated storage&quot;), see <a href="concepts.html">the concepts 
  document</a>.</p>

  <h3>Why should I use Pool?</h3>

  <p>Using Pools gives you more control over how memory is used in your 
  program. For example, you could have a situation where you want to allocate 
  a bunch of small objects at one point, and then reach a point in your 
  program where none of them are needed any more. Using pool interfaces, you 
  can choose to run their destructors or just drop them off into oblivion; the 
  pool interface will guarantee that there are no system memory leaks.</p>

  <h3>When should I use Pool?</h3>

  <p>Pools are generally used when there is a lot of allocation and 
  deallocation of small objects. Another common usage is the situation above, 
  where many objects may be dropped out of memory.</p>

  <p>In general, use Pools when you need a more efficient way to do unusual 
  memory control.</p>

  <h3>How do I use Pool?</h3>

  <p>See the <a href="interfaces.html">pool interfaces document</a>, which 
  covers the different Pool interfaces supplied by this library.</p>

  <h2>Library Structure and Dependencies</h2>

  <p>Forward declarations of all the exposed symbols for this library are in 
  the header <span class="code">&lt;boost/pool/poolfwd.hpp&gt;</span>.</p>

  <p>The library may use macros, which will be prefixed with <span class=
  "code">BOOST_POOL_</span>. The exception to this rule are the include file 
  guards, which (for file <em>xxx</em>.hpp) is <span class=
  "code">BOOST_<em>xxx</em>_HPP</span>.</p>

  <p>All exposed symbols defined by the library will be in namespace
  <span class="code">boost</span>. All symbols used only by the implementation 
  will be in namespace <span class=
  "code">boost::details::pool</span>.</p>

  <p>Every header used only by the implementation is in the subdirectory
  <span class="code">detail/</span>.</p>

  <p>Any header in the library may include any other header in the library or 
  any system-supplied header at its discretion.</p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>The Boost Pool library is a header file library. That means there is no 
  .lib, .dll, or .so to build; just add the Boost directory to your compiler's 
  include file path, and you should be good to go!</p>

  <h2>Building the Test Programs</h2>

  <p>The subdirectory &quot;build&quot; contains subdirectories for several different 
  platforms. These subdirectories contain all necessary work-around code for 
  that platform, as well as makefiles or IDE project files as appropriate.</p>

  <p>Read the &quot;readme.txt&quot; in the proper subdirectory, if it exists.</p>

  <p>The standard makefile targets are &quot;all&quot;, &quot;clean&quot; (which deletes any 
  intermediate files), and &quot;veryclean&quot; (which deletes any intermediate files 
  and executables). All intermediate and executable files are built in the 
  same directory as the makefile/project file. If there is a project file 
  supplied instead of a makefile, &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;veryclean&quot; shell scripts/batch 
  files will be provided.</p>

  <p>Project files and makefiles for additional platforms may be sent to 
  Stephen Cleary at scleary AT jerviswebb DOT com.</p>

  <h2>Future Directions</h2>

  <p>Another pool interface will be written: a base class for per-class pool 
  allocation.</p>

    The library was under way for a long time. Dietmar Kühl originally intended
    to submit an <code  >array_traits</code> class template which had most of
    the functionality present now, but only for arrays and standard containers.
        I believe this was back in 2001 or 2002.

    Meanwhile work on algorithms for containers in various contexts showed the 
    need for handling pairs of iterators, and string libraries needed special 
    treatment of character arrays. In the end it made sense to formalize the 
    minimal requirements of these similar concepts. And the results are the 
    Range concepts found in this library. </p>
    
    <p>
    The term Range was adopted because of paragraph <code>24.1/7</code> from the 
C++ standard: <blockquote>
  Most of the library's algorithmic templates that operate on data
  structures have interfaces that use ranges.  A <i>range</i> is a pair of
  iterators that designate the beginning and end of the computation. A
  range [i, i) is an empty range; in general, a range [i, j) refers to
  the elements in the data structure starting with the one pointed to
  by i and up to but not including the one pointed to by j. Range [i,
  j) is valid if and only if j is reachable from i. The result of the
  application of functions in the library to invalid ranges is
  undefined.
   </blockquote>

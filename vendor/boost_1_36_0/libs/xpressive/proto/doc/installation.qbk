[section Installing Proto]

[heading Getting Proto]

You can get Proto by downloading [^proto.zip] from
[@http://www.boost-consulting.com/vault/index.php?directory=Template%20Metaprogramming]
or by accessing Boost's SVN repository on SourceForge.net. Just go to
[@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/BoostSubversion]
and follow the instructions there for anonymous SVN access.

[heading Building with Proto]

Proto is a header-only template library, which means you don't need to alter
your build scripts or link to any separate lib file to use it. All you need
to do is `#include <boost/xpressive/proto/proto.hpp>`. This will include the
core of Proto. If you want to use any transforms, you must include the
appropriate header from the [^boost\/proto\/transform\/] directory.
Likewise for any evaluation contexts, which live in the
[^boost\/proto\/context\/] directory.

[heading Requirements]

Proto depends on Boost. You must use either Boost version 1.34.1 or the
version in SVN trunk.

[heading Supported Compilers]

Currently, Boost.Proto is known to work on the following compilers:

* Visual C++ 7.1 and higher
* GNU C++ 3.4 and higher
* Intel on Linux 8.1 and higher
* Intel on Windows 9.1 and higher

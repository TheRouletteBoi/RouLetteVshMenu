## Notes
* Some games have exceeded their memory limit so using the function GamePatching::StartSprx will not work. So a workaround is to make a eboot for that game to load your sprx. (This is mainly for AAA games like GTAV and RDR)
* Cobra 8.3 or above is required to use the launcher. If you are on 4.84 Rebug DEX and want to use Cobra 8.3 download [4.84 DEX stage2.dex](https://github.com/Evilnat/Cobra-PS3/blob/master/8.3/4.84/REBUG/REX/BIN/stage2.dex) and [stage2.cex](https://github.com/Evilnat/Cobra-PS3/blob/master/8.3/4.84/REBUG/REX/BIN/stage2.cex) transfer the file to /dev_rebug/rebug/cobra/ to your PS3.
   - `/dev_rebug/rebug/cobra/` path will only show up if you have the Rebug ToolBox opened on your console
* CCAPI 2.80rev5 or lower is required to use enstone menus. Also a console restart is required if you want to exit the game. To load a enstone menu open RouLetteVshMenu click on the menu you want to load then mount your game of choice and press R2 + L3 + R3 then finally start the game.
* If you get placed into Safe Mode when loading into a game try to unload WebMan before starting any game (R2 + L3 + R3).

## How to build

Requirements:

 * [Visual Studio 2013+](#visual-studio-2013)
 * [Sony PS3 4.75+ SDK with Visual Studio Integration](#sony-ps3-475-sdk-with-visual-studio-integration)
 * [Fixed std::string library](#fixed-stdstring-library)
 * [Git](#git)
 * [Cloning](#cloning)
 
 If you have the above requirements you can skip to [cloning the git repo](#cloning-repository).

### Visual Studio 2013+
Visual Studio 2013 isn't required to build but is required to setup [Visual Studio Integration](#sony-ps3-475-sdk-with-visual-studio-integration). With that being said if you don't plan on creating projects you can use any version of Visual Studio.

[Download Link](https://archive.org/details/en_visual_studio_ultimate_2013_x86_dvd_3175319)

### Sony PS3 4.75+ SDK with Visual Studio Integration
[Visual Studio Integration](https://archive.org/details/pro-dgfor-play-station-3v-470.1.0-leaked-by-01cedric-and-sn-0w-fr-1tz) is **REQUIRED** in order to build the project using Visual Studio.

[Download Link](https://archive.org/details/ps3-4.75-sdk)

### Fixed std::string library
Download and extract their zip file.
1. Navigate to your SDK installation folder (default: C:\usr\local\cell\target\ppu)
2. Drop the include and lib folders in and overwrite any existing files

[Download Link](https://github.com/skiff/libpsutil/releases)

### Git

If you haven't installed git on your system go and do so it is **REQUIRED** for setting up a working build environment.

[Download Link](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

### Cloning

Clone the repository including submodules:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheRouletteBoi/RouLetteVshMenu.git --recursive || echo "You don't have git installed, install it from https://git-scm.com/download/win"
```

Now, you will be able to open the solution, and simply build it in Visual Studio.
